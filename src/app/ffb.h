// Force feedback: the drive board's state (rt::DriveBoard, from the game's
// commands) on the host's wheel. A wheel with SDL haptics gets the board's
// one effect at a time on its steering axis: a spring (centring, with or
// without a dead zone, or uncentring as a negative spring), friction (the
// board's resistance) or a constant force. A gamepad without haptics gets
// rumble: the constant force on the large motor, uncentring on the small one;
// the springs and resistance, on all race, give none. A wheel whose haptics
// fail to open gets nothing, not rumble (on DirectInput, SDL's rumble is a
// shake through the wheel), and the open is tried again. The device is the
// one steering is bound to: the wheel/joystick binding first, else the
// gamepad.
